# ProjectReward

A software to shortlist and find the best options spread available for a given stock and help visualise it using payoff metric graphs. We have considered a lot of factors to make the suggestinos as sensible as possible and also tried to quantify the fair price using Black-Scholes. All data used is from Yahoo Finance.

As of now this project consists of the basic Bear and Bull spreads with calls and puts but we intend to add more complex graphs corssing between calls and puts and also options with different expiry dates.

Spreads we have:
1. Bear (Puts and Calls)
2.  Bull (Puts and Calls) 
<br />

Spreads we intend to Add:
1. Straddle (Puts and Calls)
2. Strangle (Puts and Calls)
3. Box Spreads
4. Butterfly Spreads
5. Calendar Spreads
6. Strips and Straps
<br />

We also intend this to make this a full stack development project and although inexperienced , we plan to build a Flask Application and bridge it to a native app by using React Native. Anyone who thinks that they would enjoy developing this project with us, please open an issue or star the repo or submit a pull request, we would love to collaborate and increase the scope of the project. 

As of now we have a very basic GUI setup that prints out our suggestion and shows the payoff Matric Graph

We have also set up the primitive stage 1 API and deployed it on a Flask app on a local host. We are in the process of linking it with a reactNative app to complete the bridge between backend and frontend. 
Disclaimer - We are not financial experts and we are too learning as we go along. Please use the suggestions from this repo at your own risk.<br />
